# Assignment-2
Number of Cells
Code Cells: There are 10 code cells.
Markdown Cells: There are 8 markdown cells.
Overview of Initial Cells
Code Cells
Unzipping a Data File: The first code cell uses a Unix command (!unzip) to unzip a file named FNA.zip. This likely contains the data needed for subsequent analysis or processing.
Image Loading Function: The second code cell defines a function load_images that loads images from a specified directory, resizes them to 224x224 pixels, and labels them as either 'benign' or 'malignant'. This suggests that the task might be related to image classification, possibly in a medical context (e.g., identifying benign vs malignant findings in medical images).
Installing TensorFlow Libraries: The third code cell installs TensorFlow and Keras, indicating the use of these libraries for deep learning tasks.
Markdown Cells
Data Upload Description: The first markdown cell mentions "Uploading the data," likely describing the process or the purpose of the initial data upload.
Function Description: The second markdown cell describes the function to upload images, which corresponds to the image loading function in the second code cell.
Libraries Description: The third markdown cell notes the necessity of certain libraries, aligning with the code cell that installs TensorFlow and Keras.
